    <h2> Biography:</h2>

    <p>
        I was born in 1990 , the oldest of <strong>Four</strong> girls, a wife for 6 years, a mum to a
        fearless, kind and engergetic 4 year old boy.
    </p>
    <p>I was born in Newmarket, Ontario, Canada. I moved to barrie in grade 3 when my parents split and
        stayed in barrie till half way through highschool (<strong>YES</strong> my mother made me move in highschool). 
        I moved back to Newmarket when my mom met my step dad. We went from a house hold of 3 to 6 and my poor step dad
         was now outnumbered by us girls 5 to 1 ( <strong><em>mood swings and all</em></strong>). </p>
    <p> I graduated highschool in 2008. Went to Seneca Collage and was a social worker/CYW for 
        10 hectic yet rewarding years. Then covid hit and like many people reevaluate my career and
        burn out it was causing with my home life. That leads me to where I am now Georgian Collage !
    </p>
    <p> My <strong>BIGGEST</strong> achivement to date is becoming a mom. Before my son I would have said traveling the
        world or my sporting achivements in my youth. There is something about becoming a parent at least 
    for myself changed my perspective on life. </p>
    <p>My goal is to find a career I am passionate about again and contiune to keep pushing myself to be 
        the <strong>BEST</strong> mother, wife , sister and daughter I can be.  </p>
